<h2>The Verdict</h2>
<p class="uniqueText"> &lsquo;Today's surfboard nose guards are designed to protect the board, not the surfer. The Blunt changes all that. This is the first surfboard eye guard designed from beginning to end thinking about the safety of the surfer and others around him or her.&rsquo;</p>

<h2>The Comparison</h2>
    <section class="col1-2">
        <img class="comparisonImg" src="img/theBluntComparison.jpg" alt="Photo of the product: The Blunt">
        <p>This is the the future of noseguards. The blunt is not a simple piece of plastic. It has been engineered to perfection in order to add a series of protective features that will help the enjoyment of surfing last.</p>

        <p>Clearly, the traditional nose guards have one evident flaw, they still end in a spear shaped tip. Basis knowledge simply told us that that was not a good idea. But, we wanted to scientifically prove that a blunt tip is the right way to go when designing for surfing eye guards... and we did!</p>

        <br><p>I've been surfing since I was 8 years old, last year I had a terrible accident, while doing a high air I had a harsh landing and the tip of my surfboard pierced my left cheek, fortunately no permanent damage was done, but if I would have had The Blunt as a surf tip protector I'm sure the accident would just have been a common everyday bruise.</p>

        <h3>Storm Portman</h3>           
        <p class="italic"> Age 14 </p>
        <p class="italic"> Satellite Beach, Florida </p>
        <br><p> Treading water amid 4 to 5 foot waves, Storm Portman prepared to hop back on her surfboard offshore from Pelican Beach Park. However, her surfboard leash got tangled around her foot, and the nose of the board was pointed toward her head. When she turned her body, the board shot forward â€” and rammed into her left eye. &laquo;It happened really fast. I covered my eye, but my eye wasn't really in the right place,&raquo; she recalled.
        <br>Portman, 14, the reigning Eastern Surfing Association girls champion, suffered a "globe rupture" of her eyeball in Jan. 15 accident.</p>
